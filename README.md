# What?

*Vernufteling* is my personal attempt to perfect my keyboard layout, strictly to my own
desires.

# Why?

In the *Kulturkreis* where I live, we type azerty. The azerty layout is
inferior, and the same goes for the qwerty layout. I have extensively tried
Colemak and Workman (and Workman Programmer), but they too have their issues for
my hands and habits.

I write a lot of
- English
- Dutch
- Python
- Clojure
- LaTeX
- \*NIX commands

I also write some
- Ancient Greek

This keyboard layout strives to be a compromise for those needs.

# How

Actually, there are many ways to change the keyboard layout, so I figure I
should create one more. The vkb syntax for keyboard layouts is very abstract,
and should be recompiled to another syntax for concrete use.

# By what other name?

I chose the name *vernufteling* in homage to Simon Stevin's proposed
translation for the Dutch/Flemish word for an *engineer*. His proposal never
caught on (we still speak of *ingenieurs*), but his wit stroke my cord, so to
speak.

Also, the Google search space for the term is empty except for Stevin.

# Caveat lector

Use however you like. No guarantees given whatsoever. Expect volatility.
