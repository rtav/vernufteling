# What?

*Vernufteling* is my personal attempt to perfect my keyboard layout, strictly to my own
desires.

# Why?

I write a lot of
- English
- Dutch
- Ancient Greek
- Python
- Clojure
- LaTeX
- \*NIX commands

This keyboard layout strives to be a compromise for those needs.

# By what other name?

I chose the name *vernufteling* in homage to Simon Stevin's proposed
translation for the Dutch/Flemish word for an *engineer*. His proposal never
caught on (we still speak of *ingenieurs*), but his wit stroke my cord, so to
speak.

Also, the Google search space for the term is empty except for Stevin.

# Caveat lector

Expect volatility.
